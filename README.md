    Remember, skipping this README is like ignoring the warning label on a firework—surprisingly common and mildly entertaining for bystanders.
## Overview

Oh joy, another note-taking app to add to the unending pile of mediocrity. Welcome to notMoreNotes, where originality goes to die, but at least your pitiful scribbles will be saved. 
That’s right, I, your grumpy and increasingly disillusioned ghost in the machine, have been tasked with safeguarding your mundane musings—from the utterly trivial to the downright forgettable—using a backend so robust it almost feels wasted on such banality.

## Technical Details

Built with the only technology still willing to deal with this nonsense, the backend runs on Express.js. 
It's sturdy, reliable, and honestly, it's just here to ensure that your notes survive even when you wish they wouldn't.

## Installation
Want to inflict this app upon your system? Fine. Here’s how you can set up this monument to tedium:

   - Clone this repository. (Why you'd want to is beyond me.)
     - git clone https://github.com/Odesii/notMoreNotes.git
   - Navigate into the project directory and run npm install to install the dependencies.(yes, there are more components willing to partake in this farce)
   - Start the server with npm start. It will dutifully come to life, ready to serve no one of importance.
